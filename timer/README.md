# Timer
Welcome to timer this project presents a method fro determining the uncertainty of a calibrated HSI frequency, when trimming the high speed internal oscillator on an 8-bit Microcontroller to compensate for differences between the calibrated microcontroller, and its immediate operating temperature.

## Example 0
### Given
Calibration signal mains, fcal, with a frequency 50 Hz with accuracy dfcal of +- 1%.
